        The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
        moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week for
        adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110 minutes every day? While it
        might seem like a high number to hit, dedicating 110 minutes daily to
        sporting activities may offer unparalleled benefits to physical health,
        mental well-being, and overall quality of life.
